# Frame of Faith Hub

This is the project starter for your website.

To deploy:
1. Upload this repo to GitHub.
2. Import it into Vercel.
3. Add environment variables (DATABASE_URL, ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL).
4. Click Deploy.

If you lost the full-featured version, ask me and I will regenerate it with admin panel, Stripe donations, and SEO already included.
